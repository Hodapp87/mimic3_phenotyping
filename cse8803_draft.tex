% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional

% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.

% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\begin{abstract}
With large volumes of health care data comes the research area of
computational phenotyping, making use of techniques such as machine
learning to describe illnesses and other clinical concepts from the
data itself.  The ``traditional'' approach of using supervised
learning relies on a domain expert, and has two main limitations:
requiring skilled humans to supply correct labels limits its
scalability and accuracy, and relying on existing clinical
descriptions limits the sorts of patterns that can be found. For
instance, it may fail to acknowledge that a disease treated as a
single condition may really have several subtypes with different
phenotypes, as seems to be the case with asthma and heart
disease. Some recent papers cite successes instead using unsupervised
learning.  This shows great potential for finding patterns in
Electronic Health Records that would otherwise be hidden and that can
lead to greater understanding of conditions and treatments. This work
implements a method derived strongly from Lasko \emph{et al.}, but
implements it in Apache Spark and Python and generalizes it to
laboratory time-series data in MIMIC-III.  It will be released as an
open-source tool for exploration, analysis, and visualization.

\section{Introduction \& Background}

The field of \emph{computational phenotyping}\cite{Che2015} has
emerged recently as a way of learning more from the increasing volumes
of Electronic Health Records available, and the volume of this data
ties it in naturally with fields like machine learning and data
mining.  The ``traditional'' approach of supervised learning over
classifications has two noted 

\begin{itemize}
\item{It requires the time and attention of that domain expert in
  order to provide classification information over which to train a
  model, and this requirement on human attention limits the amount of
  data available (and, to an extent, its accuracy.)}
\item{It tends to limit the patterns that can be found to what
  existing classifications acknowledge.  If a disease treated as a
  single condition really has multiple subtypes with different
  phenotypes, the model will not reflect this - for instance, asthma
  and heart disease\cite{Lasko2013}.}
\end{itemize}

Some recent papers\cite{Marlin,Lasko2013,Johnson2016} cite
successes with approaches instead using unsupervised learning on
time-series data.  In Lasko \emph{et al.}\cite{Lasko2013}, such an
approach applied to serum uric acid measurements was able to
distinguish gout and acute leukemia with no prior classifications
given in training.  Marlin \emph{et al.}\cite{Marlin} examines 13
physiological measures from a pediatric ICU (such as pulse oximetric
saturation, heart rate, and respiratory rate). Che \emph{et
  al.}\cite{Che2015} likewise uses ICU data, but focuses on certain
ICD-9 codes rather than mortality.

This approach still has technical barriers.  Time-series in healthcare
data frequently are noisy, spare, heterogeneous, or irregularly
sampled, and commonly Gaussian processes are employed here in order to
condition the data into a more regular form as a pre-processing step.
In \cite{Lasko2013}, Gaussian process regression produces a model
which generates a continuous, interpolated time-series providing both
predicted mean and variance.  In \cite{Ghassemi2015} it is used to
instead derive a latent representation from correlated time-series.
Che \emph{et al.}\cite{Che2015} does not use Gaussian process
regression, but rather fills irregularities in the data by propagating
forward or backward.

Che \emph{et al.}\cite{Che2015} notes that ``shallow'' clustering
models such as Gaussian mixture models (as in \cite{Marlin}) are used
too, deep learning succeeds more here at finding latent factors and
extracting concepts - which is particularly important given the
complexity of bodies and processes.  Lasko \emph{et
  al.}\cite{Lasko2013} applies a two-layer stacked sparse autoencoder
(compared with a five-layer stacked denoising autoencoder in
\cite{Che2015}), but the approach that looks like it could extend to a
deep learner with the addition of layers.

\section{Problem Formulation}

The goal undertaken here is to reimplement a combination of some
earlier results (focusing mainly on that of Lasko \emph{et
  al.}\cite{Lasko2013}) using \href{http://spark.apache.org/}{Apache
  Spark} and the MIMIC-III critical care database\cite{Johnson2016a},
and able to run on a ``standard'' Spark setup such as
\href{https://aws.amazon.com/emr/}{Amazon Elastic MapReduce}. The
software behind this work is also intended to be released as an open
source tool for accomodating exploration, analysis, and visualization
using the techniques described herein.

Most of the needed algorithms are available in existing machine
learning libraries in languages such as MATLAB or R, however, these
are less accessible to the aforementioned ``standard'' setup or may be
more cumbersome to integrate with Apache Spark.  While Apache Spark
runs on top of Java/JVM infrastructure and has access to a
considerable ecosystem of Java-based, relevant libraries do not always
exist or do not exist in a form which works well with Spark.

% TODO: Mention integration with other languages via SparkR, PySpark,
% Java APIs?

The main problems that the implementation tries to address within
these parameters are:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Loading the MIMIC-III database into a form usable from Spark}
\item{Identifying relevant laboratory tests, admissions, and ICD-9
  codes on which to focus}
\item{Preprocessing the time-series data with Gaussian process
  regression}
\item{Using a two-layer stacked sparse autoencoder to perform feature
  learning}
\item{Visualizing the new feature space and identifying potential
  clusters}
\end{itemize}

\section{Approach and Implementation}

\subsection{Loading and Selecting Data}

The MIMIC-III database is supplied as a collection of \texttt{.csv.gz}
files (that is, comma-separated values, compressed with gzip).  By way
of \texttt{spack-csv}, Apache Spark 2.x is able to load these files
natively as tabular data, i.e. a \texttt{DataFrame}.  All work
described here used the following tables\cite{Johnson2016a}:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{LABEVENTS}: Timestamped laboratory measurements for patients
\item \texttt{DIAGNOSES\_ICD}: ICD-9 diagnoses for patients (per-admission)
\item \texttt{D\_ICD\_DIAGNOSES}: Information on each ICD-9 diagnosis
\item \texttt{D\_LABEVENTS}: Information on each type of laboratory event
\end{itemize}

% TODO: Mention LOINC code, 11558-4?

From these the laboratory time-series for \texttt{ITEMID} of 50820
(blood pH) were extracted, under the conditions that at least 3
samples were available for a given admission, and that the admission
involved at least one ICD-9 code 518 (other lung diseases), or at
least one ICD-9 code 584 (acute renal failure), but not both.  The
field \texttt{VALUEUOM} also was checked to ensure that units of
measure were consistent.  (This combination of tests and codes was not
chosen for any particular reason except that the dataset was able to
accomodate it.)

All processing at this stage was done via Spark's DataFrame
operations, aside from the final conversion to an RDD containing
individual time-series.

This produced a total of 9,035 unique admissions, 8,219 unique
subjects, and 187,374 time-stamped samples.  70\% of these admissions
were randomly selected for the training set, and the remaining 30\%
for the testing set.

\subsection{Preprocessing}

\subsubsection{Time Warping}

The covariance function that is used in Gaussian process regression
(and explained after this section) contains a time-scale parameter
$\tau$ which embeds assumptions on how closely correlated nearby
samples are in time.  This value is assumed not to change within the
time-series - that is, it is assumed to be
\textit{stationary}\cite{Lasko2013}.  This assumption is often
incorrect, but under the assumption that more rapidly-varying things
(that is, shorter time-scale) are measured more frequently, an
approximation can be applied to try to make the time-series more
stationary - in the form of changing the distance in time between
every pair of adjacent samples in order to shorten longer distances,
but lengthen shorter ones\cite{Lasko2013}.  For original distance $d$,
the warped distance is $d'=d^{1/3}+b$, using $a=3, b=0$ (these
values were taken directly from equation 5 of \cite{Lasko2013} and not
tuned further).

Thomas Lasko also related in an email that this assumption (that
measurement frequency was proportional to how volatile the thing being
measured is) is not true for all medical tests.  He referred to
another paper of his\cite{Lasko2015} for a more robust approach,
however, this is not used here.

\subsubsection{Gaussian Process Regression}

In order to condition the irregular and sparse time-series data from
the prior step, Gaussian process regression was used.  The method used
here is what Lasko \emph{et al.}\cite{Lasko2013} described, which in
more depth is the method described in algorithm 2.1 of Rasmussen \&
Williams\cite{Rasmussen2004}.

In brief, Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a Bayesian
non-parametric, or less parametric, method of supervised learning over
noisy observations\cite{Ebden2015,Lasko2013,Rasmussen2004}.  It is not
completely free-form, but it infers a function constrained only by the
mean function (which here is assumed to be 0 and can be ignored) and
the covariance function $k(t,t')$ of an underlying
infinite-dimensional Gaussian distribution.  It is not exclusive to
time-series data, but $t$ is used here as in this work GPR is done
only on time-series data.

That covariance function $k$ defines how dependent observations are on
each other, and so a common choice is the squared
exponential\cite{Ebden2015}:

$$k(t,t') = \sigma_n^2\exp\bigg[\frac{-(t-t')^2}{2l^2}\bigg]$$

Note that $k$ approaches a maximum of $\sigma_n^2$ as $t$ and $t'$ are
further, and $k$ approaches a minimum of 0 as $t$ and $t'$ are closer.
Intuitively, this makes sense for many ``natural'' functions: we
expect closer $t$ values to have more strongly correlated function
values, and $l$ defines the time scale of that correlation.

The rational quadratic function is used here instead as it better
models things that may occur on many time scales\cite{Lasko2013}:

$$k(t,t') = \sigma_n^2\bigg[1+\frac{(t-t')^2}{2\alpha\tau^2}\bigg]^{-\alpha}$$

Rasmussen \& Williams\cite{Rasmussen2004} supplies a formula for
computing the log marginal likelihood of the target values
$\mathbf{y}$ given the inputs $X$ (both $n\times1$ row vectors of
target values and input values, respectively), where $K$ is a $n\times
n$ matrix for which $K_{ij}=k(X_i,X_j)$:

$$\log p(\mathbf{y}|X) = -\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{y}^\top(K+\sigma_n^2I)^{-1}-\frac{1}{2}\log |K+\sigma_n^2I|-\frac{n}{2}\log2\pi$$

An equivalent version that uses Cholesky decomposition rather than
$n\times n$ matrix inversion is given in algorithm 2.1 of the
aforementioned text, and this is what is actually used in the code.

In specific, in order to optimize the hyperparameters $\sigma_n$,
$\tau$, and $\alpha$ of the covariance function, $\sum\log
p(\mathbf{y}|X)$ was roughly maximized over every time-series in the
training set (following the time warping of the prior section) using a
grid search.  The values found for this were $\sigma_n=1.4$,
$\alpha=0.1$, and $\tau=3.55$.

Hyperparameter optimization was likely the most time-consuming step of
processing.  However, this step also is a highly parallelizable one,
and so it was amenable to the distributed nature of Apache Spark.

\subsubsection{Interpolation}

The remainder of algorithm 2.1 is not reproduced here, but the code
directly implemented this method using the rational quadratic function
(and hyperparameters given above) as the covariance function.  This
inferred for each individual time-series a continuous function
producing predictive mean and variance for any input $t$ (for which
they use the notation $\mathbf{x^*}$ for ``test input'').

As in \cite{Lasko2013}, all of these inferred functions were then
evaluated at a regular sampling of time values (i.e. via the test
input $\mathbf{x^*}$) with padding added before and after each time
series.  For this data set, the sampling was done at intervals of 12
hours, with 15 samples of padding (that is, 7.5 days) at the beginning
and end of each time-series.

In effect, this mapped each individual time-series first to a
continuous function, and then to a new ``interpolated'' time-series
containing predicted mean and variance at the sampled times described
above (a total of 341,819 interpolated time-series samples).  These
interpolated time-series were then the input to later steps.

\subsection{Feature Learning with Autoencoder}

A stacked sparse 2-layer autoencoder was then used to perform feature
learning.  The implementation used here was a combination of what was
described in \cite{Lasko2013} (which closely follows the UFLDL
Tutorial from Stanford\cite{Ng}), and Fran\c cois Chollet's
guide\cite{Chollet} on using the Python library
\href{https://keras.io/}{Keras} to implement autoencoders.
Specifically, Keras was used with
\href{http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/}{Theano} (GPU-enabled)
as the backend, however, it should work identically using
\href{https://www.tensorflow.org/}{TensorFlow} as the backend.

% TODO:
% - The use of 'patches' and their sampling
% - How many patches?  How frequent?
% - Validation
% - Specific Keras architecture (and diagram?)

% From these laboratory measurements and that methodology, I aim to
% produce a transformation to a reduced feature space using a
% combination of Gaussian process regression to condition
% irregularly-sampled input data and autoencoders to learn a
% reduced-dimension form of them.  Using labels such as certain ICD-9
% codes, I will train classifiers from the reduced form, and compute
% their AUCs for these codes.  I will also examine them for apparent
% clusterings that may suggest multiple different phenotypes for some
% label, as seen in \cite[figure 5]{Lasko2013}.

\section{Experimental Evaluation}

Presently, not many results are available as further work is needed.

% TODO (time permitting):
% - Visualization of weights

\section{Conclusions \& Further Work}

This work is still in need of further experimentation and refining.
The code is intended to be released as an open-source tool that allows
exploration in MIMIC-III data but could easily be generalized to other
time-series data, however, the code is not yet released.

Several optimizations also may help; for instance, hyperparameter
optimization is currently done with a grid search, but would more
sensibly done with a more intelligent optimization algorithm (such as
SGD).  The time warping function has parameters that could be tuned,
or more extensive changes\cite{Lasko2015} could be made to try to make
the time-series more stationary.  Other covariance functions may be
more appropriate as well.

The intention was that as much as possible could be executed within
Apache Spark on ``standard'' infrastructure such as
\href{https://aws.amazon.com/emr/}{Amazon EMR} or
\href{https://databricks.com/}{Databricks}.  The original intention
was to use \href{https://deeplearning4j.org/}{DL4J}, a native Java
library which already supports Apache Spark, but problems prevented
this from working correctly.  It may be possible to still use DL4J,
there may be other Java-compatible libraries accessible from Apache
Spark, or a closer integration with Keras may be possible via Spark's
built-in \texttt{pyspark} support (and performance may still be
acceptable if GPU support is unavailable).

Some other areas should perhaps be explored further too.  One
incremental change is in the use of multiple-task Gaussian processes
(MTGPs); the work done here handles only individual time-series, while
MIMIC-III is rich in parallel time-series that correlate with each
other.  Ghassemi \emph{et al.}\cite{Ghassemi2015} explored the use of
MTGPs to find a latent representation of multiple correlated
time-series, but did not use this representation for subsequent
feature learning.  Another incremental change is in the use of
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to learn a feature space that is
sufficiently low-dimensional that techniques such as t-SNE are not
required for effective visualization.

A more extensive change could involve using recurrent neural networks
(RNNs).  Deep networks such as RNNs such as Long Short-Term Memories
have shown promise in their ability to more directly handle
sequences\cite{Sutskever2014} and clinical time-series data, including
handling missing data\cite{Lipton2015, Lipton2015a, Lipton2016}.
However, they are primarily used for supervised learning, but could
potentially be treated similarly as autoencoders (as in
\cite{Klapper-Rybicka2001}), that is, trained with the same input and
output data in order to learn a reduced representation of the input.
This approach would avoid some of the need to perform Gaussian Process
Regression, however, it still may not cope well with time-series data
that is very irregular.
