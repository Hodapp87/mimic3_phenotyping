	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop an intensive care unit research database applying automated techniques to aggregate high-resolution diagnostic and therapeutic data from a large, diverse population of adult intensive care unit patients. This freely available database is intended to support epidemiologic research in critical care medicine and serve as a resource to evaluate new clinical decision support and monitoring algorithms.
DESIGN: Data collection and retrospective analysis.
SETTING: All adult intensive care units (medical intensive care unit, surgical intensive care unit, cardiac care unit, cardiac surgery recovery unit) at a tertiary care hospital.
PATIENTS: Adult patients admitted to intensive care units between 2001 and 2007.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II (MIMIC-II) database consists of 25,328 intensive care unit stays. The investigators collected detailed information about intensive care unit patient stays, including laboratory data, therapeutic intervention profiles such as vasoactive medication drip rates and ventilator settings, nursing progress notes, discharge summaries, radiology reports, provider order entry data, International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes, and, for a subset of patients, high-resolution vital sign trends and waveforms. Data were automatically deidentified to comply with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act standards and integrated with relational database software to create electronic intensive care unit records for each patient stay. The data were made freely available in February 2010 through the Internet along with a detailed user's guide and an assortment of data processing tools. The overall hospital mortality rate was 11.7\%, which varied by critical care unit. The median intensive care unit length of stay was 2.2 days (interquartile range, 1.1-4.4 days). According to the primary International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes, the following disease categories each comprised at least 5\% of the case records: diseases of the circulatory system (39.1\%); trauma (10.2\%); diseases of the digestive system (9.7\%); pulmonary diseases (9.0\%); infectious diseases (7.0\%); and neoplasms (6.8\%).
CONCLUSIONS: MIMIC-II documents a diverse and very large population of intensive care unit patient stays and contains comprehensive and detailed clinical data, including physiological waveforms and minute-by-minute trends for a subset of records. It establishes a new public-access resource for critical care research, supporting a diverse range of analytic studies spanning epidemiology, clinical decision-rule development, and electronic tool development.},

	abstract = {Evening the score against sepsis
Sepsis is a major cause of death, which remains difficult to treat despite modern antibiotics. Early aggressive treatment of this disease improves patient mortality, but the tools currently available in the clinic do not predict who will develop sepsis and its late manifestation, septic shock, until the patients are already in advanced stages of the disease. Henry et al. used readily available data from patient monitors and medical records to develop TREWScore, a targeted real-time early warning score that predicts in advance which patients are at risk for septic shock. With a median lead time of over 24 hours, this scoring algorithm may allow clinicians enough time to intervene before the patients suffer the most damaging effects of sepsis.
Sepsis is a leading cause of death in the United States, with mortality highest among patients who develop septic shock. Early aggressive treatment decreases morbidity and mortality. Although automated screening tools can detect patients currently experiencing severe sepsis and septic shock, none predict those at greatest risk of developing shock. We analyzed routinely available physiological and laboratory data from intensive care unit patients and developed “TREWScore,” a targeted real-time early warning score that predicts which patients will develop septic shock. TREWScore identified patients before the onset of septic shock with an area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve (AUC) of 0.83 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.81 to 0.85]. At a specificity of 0.67, TREWScore achieved a sensitivity of 0.85 and identified patients a median of 28.2 [interquartile range (IQR), 10.6 to 94.2] hours before onset. Of those identified, two-thirds were identified before any sepsis-related organ dysfunction. In comparison, the Modified Early Warning Score, which has been used clinically for septic shock prediction, achieved a lower AUC of 0.73 (95\% CI, 0.71 to 0.76). A routine screening protocol based on the presence of two of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria, suspicion of infection, and either hypotension or hyperlactatemia achieved a lower sensitivity of 0.74 at a comparable specificity of 0.64. Continuous sampling of data from the electronic health records and calculation of TREWScore may allow clinicians to identify patients at risk for septic shock and provide earlier interventions that would prevent or mitigate the associated morbidity and mortality.
TREWScore, a targeted early warning score for septic shock, identifies patients who develop septic shock before the onset of sepsis-related organ failure.

	abstract = {Drug-resistant epilepsy with uncontrolled severe seizures despite state-of-the-art medical treatment continues to be a major clinical problem for up to one in three patients with epilepsy. Although drug resistance may emerge or remit in the course of epilepsy or its treatment, in most patients, drug resistance seems to be continuous and to occur de novo. Unfortunately, current antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) do not seem to prevent or to reverse drug resistance in most patients, but add-on therapy with novel AEDs is able to exert a modest seizure reduction in as many as 50\% of patients in short-term clinical trials, and a few become seizure free during the trial. It is not known why and how epilepsy becomes drug resistant, while other patients with seemingly identical seizure types can achieve seizure control with medication. Several putative mechanisms underlying drug resistance in epilepsy have been identified in recent years. Based on experimental and clinical studies, two major neurobiologic theories have been put forward: (a) removal of AEDs from the epileptogenic tissue through excessive expression of multidrug transporters, and (b) reduced drug-target sensitivity in epileptogenic brain tissue. On the clinical side, genetic and clinical features and structural brain lesions have been associated with drug resistance in epilepsy. In this article, we review the laboratory and clinical evidence to date supporting the drug-transport and the drug-target hypotheses and provide directions for future research, to define more clearly the role of these hypotheses in the clinical spectrum of drug-resistant epilepsy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: More than 30 percent of patients with epilepsy have inadequate control of seizures with drug therapy, but why this happens and whether it can be predicted are unknown. We studied the response to antiepileptic drugs in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy to identify factors associated with subsequent poor control of seizures.
METHODS: We prospectively studied 525 patients (age, 9 to 93 years) who were given a diagnosis, treated, and followed up at a single center between 1984 and 1997. Epilepsy was classified as idiopathic (with a presumed genetic basis), symptomatic (resulting from a structural abnormality), or cryptogenic (resulting from an unknown underlying cause). Patients were considered to be seizure-free if they had not had any seizures for at least one year.
RESULTS: Among the 525 patients, 333 (63 percent) remained seizure-free during antiepileptic-drug treatment or after treatment was stopped. The prevalence of persistent seizures was higher in patients with symptomatic or cryptogenic epilepsy than in those with idiopathic epilepsy (40 percent vs. 26 percent, P=0.004) and in patients who had had more than 20 seizures before starting treatment than in those who had had fewer (51 percent vs. 29 percent, P{\textless}0.001). The seizure-free rate was similar in patients who were treated with a single established drug (67 percent) and patients who were treated with a single new drug (69 percent). Among 470 previously untreated patients, 222 (47 percent) became seizure-free during treatment with their first antiepileptic drug and 67 (14 percent) became seizure-free during treatment with a second or third drug. In 12 patients (3 percent) epilepsy was controlled by treatment with two drugs. Among patients who had no response to the first drug, the percentage who subsequently became seizure-free was smaller (11 percent) when treatment failure was due to lack of efficacy than when it was due to intolerable side effects (41 percent) or an idiosyncratic reaction (55 percent).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have many seizures before therapy or who have an inadequate response to initial treatment with antiepileptic drugs are likely to have refractory epilepsy.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To classify the grade of antiepileptic drug (AED) resistance in a cohort of patients with focal epilepsies, to recognize the risk factors for AED resistance, and to estimate the helpfulness of "new-generation" AEDs.
METHODS: We included 1,155 adults with focal epilepsies who were observed consecutively after 1990 and followed regularly at two epilepsy centers. We systematically collected the clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic data using a custom-written database. We classified the patients as seizure-free or AED resistant according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) criteria, and we evaluated the risk factors associated with AED resistance using logistic regression analysis. We further grouped AED-resistant patients in different grades (I, II, and III) according to the number of AEDs already tried as proposed by Perucca.
KEY FINDINGS: AED resistance occurred in 57.8\% of the 729 patients with symptomatic focal epilepsies and was positively associated with electroencephalography (EEG) abnormalities, seizure type, and the presence of mesial temporal sclerosis. Among 426 patients without detectable causes, the percentage of AED resistance was significantly lower (39.2\%) and correlated with EEG abnormalities and psychiatric symptoms. Among AED-resistant patients, the majority (64.6\%) had tried three or more AEDs, which fit the more severe grade III proposed by Perucca. Among seizure-free patients, more than one-half (57\%) needed to try two or more AEDs before reaching seizure control (14.9\% needed three or more AEDs). Furthermore, among seizure-free patients who could be previously classified as resistant to two or more AEDs, 52.2\% reached seizure freedom while receiving treatment with "new generation" AEDs.
SIGNIFICANCE: The ILAE classification of AED resistance, as well the graded classification proposed by Perucca, was easily exploitable in our patients, although these classifications systems appear to have a limited value in predicting seizure outcome. Actually, a small but not negligible percentage of patients reached seizure freedom after trying several AEDs (including "new" AEDs), suggesting repeated trials may be necessary for seizure control.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Using an adult cohort of patients with generalized epilepsy, we aimed to identify risk factors for development of drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), which if identifiable would allow patients to receive earlier treatment and more specifically individualized treatment plans.
METHODS: For the case-control study, 118 patients with generalized epilepsy (GE) between the ages of 18 and 75 were included after selection from a database of 800 patients referred from throughout the Saskatchewan Epilepsy Program. Definitions were used in accordance with ILAE criteria. The odds ratio and its confidence interval were calculated. We performed a logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Forty-four (37\%) patients fulfilled the definition of DRE (cases), and seizures in 74 (63\%) patients were not intractable (controls). Patients with DRE were significantly younger than the controls at the onset of epilepsy (6.6 vs. 18.8years, p={\textless}0.001). Significant variables on univariate analysis were the following: epilepsy diagnosed prior to 12years (OR: 12.1, CI: 4.8-29.9, p{\textless}0.001), previous history of status epilepticus (OR: 15.1, CI: 3.2-70.9, p{\textless}0.001), developmental delay (OR: 12.6, CI: 4.9-32, p{\textless}0.001), and cryptogenic epilepsy (OR: 10.5, CI: 3.9-27.8, p{\textless}0.001). Our study showed some protective factors for DRE such as a good response to first AED, idiopathic etiology, and history of febrile seizures. In the logistic regression analysis, two variables remained statistically significant: developmental delay and more than one seizure type.
CONCLUSION: Our study has identified a set of variables that predict DRE in patients with generalized epilepsy. Risk factors identified in our study are similar to those previously identified in pediatric studies, however, our study is specifically tailored to adult patients with generalized epilepsy.},

	abstract = {Accurate knowledge of a patient's disease state and trajectory is critical in a clinical setting. Modern electronic healthcare records contain an increasingly large amount of data, and the ability to automatically identify the factors that influence patient outcomes stand to greatly improve the efficiency and quality of care. We examined the use of latent variable models (viz. Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to decompose free-text hospital notes into meaningful features, and the predictive power of these features for patient mortality. We considered three prediction regimes: (1) baseline prediction, (2) dynamic (time-varying) outcome prediction, and (3) retrospective outcome prediction. In each, our prediction task differs from the familiar time-varying situation whereby data accumulates; since fewer patients have long ICU stays, as we move forward in time fewer patients are available and the prediction task becomes increasingly difficult. We found that latent topic-derived features were effective in determining patient mortality under three timelines: in-hospital, 30 day post-discharge, and 1 year post-discharge mortality. Our results demonstrated that the latent topic features important in predicting hospital mortality are very different from those that are important in post-discharge mortality. In general, latent topic features were more predictive than structured features, and a combination of the two performed best. The time-varying models that combined latent topic features and baseline features had AUCs that reached 0.85, 0.80, and 0.77 for in-hospital, 30 day post-discharge and 1 year post-discharge mortality respectively. Our results agreed with other work suggesting that the first 24 hours of patient information are often the most predictive of hospital mortality. Retrospective models that used a combination of latent topic features and structured features achieved AUCs of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.81 for in-hospital, 30 day, and 1-year mortality prediction. Our work focuses on the dynamic (time-varying) setting because models from this regime could facilitate an on-going severity stratification system that helps direct care-staff resources and inform treatment strategies.},
